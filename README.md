# Wolt-Market-User-Segmentation-Analysis
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for the Wolt Market User Segmentation Analysis project conducted in February 2023. The project aimed to segment users of the Wolt Market service based on their ordering history and behavior using data analysis techniques.

Key Features:

1. Utilized K-means clustering algorithm from the sci-kit-learn Python library for user segmentation.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to identify relevant factors for segmentation.
3. Presented actionable insights and recommendations through impactful visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

The repository includes:

1. Python code files implementing the data analysis, clustering, and visualization techniques.
2. Jupyter Notebook showcasing the visualizations of user segments and their ordering patterns.

The Wolt Market User Segmentation Analysis project provides valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, enabling Wolt Market to enhance their services and optimize the user experience. It serves as a resource for those interested in understanding the data analysis techniques and methodologies employed in the project.
